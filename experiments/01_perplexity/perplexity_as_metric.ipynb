    "# Perplexity as Metric\n",

    "The text1.txt and text2.txt files are slightly different. The text1.txt was created with the GUI and setting minVerticalGapWidth to 20, the other one using 5. text1.txt gets a lower score than text2.txt and text1.txt correctly identifies paragraphs. As a side effect, I realized that using the GUI is a bad idea because it looks like it alters the PDF is a way I don't understand. I realized that the using only the API (without the GUI) created fine output text. So this was still an example to show that perplexity can be used as a metric. \n",
