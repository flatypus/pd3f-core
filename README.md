# `pdddf` [![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pdddf.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/pdddf/) [![PyPI - Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pdddf.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/pdddf/) [![PyPI - Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/pdddf)](https://pypistats.org/packages/pdddf)

*Experimental, use with care.*

Python Package to **reconstruct** the **original text** from **PDFs** using language models.
Checkout out [pd3f](https://github.com/pd3f/pd3f) for a full Docker-based text extraction pipeline using `pdddf`.

`pdddf` first uses [Parsr](https://github.com/axa-group/Parsr) to chunk PDFs into lines and paragraphs.
Then, it uses the underlying Python package [dehyphen](https://github.com/jfilter/dehyphen) to reconstruct the text in the most probable way.
The probability is derived by calculating the [perplexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perplexity) with [Flair](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair)`s character-based [language models](https://machinelearningmastery.com/statistical-language-modeling-and-neural-language-models/).

It's mainly developed for German but should work with other languages as well.
The project is still in an early stage.
Expect rough edges and rapid changes.
Documentation will get improved (at some point).

## Installation

```bash
pip install pdddf
```

or

```bash
poetry add pdddf
```

You need also a docker container of Parsr running on `localhost:3001` ([script](./scripts/locale_parsr.sh)).

You may also use tunnel a remote Parsr instance ([script](./scripts/locale_parsr.sh)) or choose a remote address.


## Usage

```python
from pdddf import extract

text, tables = extract(file_path, tables=False, experimental=False, force_gpu=False, lang="multi", parsr_location="localhost:3001")
```

`file_path`: path a to a PDF. If it's a scanned PDF it needs to get OCR beforehand (outside of this package).

`tables`: extract tables via Parsr (with Camelot / Tabula), results into list of CSV strings

`experimental`: leave out duplicate text in headers / footers and pull all footnotes to the end of the document. Working unreliable right now.

`force_gpu`: Raise error if CUDA is not available

`lang`: Set the language, `de` for German, `en` for English, `es` for Spanish, `fr` for French. Some fast (less accurate) models exists.
So set `multi-v0-fast` to get fast model for German, French (and some other languages). [Background](https://github.com/jfilter/dehyphen#usage)

`parsr_location`: Setting a remote parsr location

### GPU Support (CUDA)

Using CUDA speeds up the evaluation with Flair.
But you need an (expensive) GPU.
You need to set up your GPU with CUDA.
[Here a guide for Ubuntu 18.04](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-gpu-installation-on-ubuntu-18-4-9b12230a1d31)

1. install [conda (via miniconda)](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
2. create a new conda enviroment & activate it
3. Install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) with CUDA: `conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch` (example)
4. Install pdddf with poetry: `poetry add pdddf`

Poetry realizes that it is run within a conda virtual env so it doesn't create a new one.
Since setting up CUDA is hard, install it with the most easy way (with conda).


## Background

### Parsr Config

At the heart of `pdddf` is the JSON output of parsr.
Some comments on how and why certain things were chosen.
[Parsr's documentation about the different modules](https://github.com/axa-group/Parsr/tree/master/server/src/processing)

Parsr has several module to classify paragraphs into certain types.
They offer a list detections as well as an heading detection.
In my experience, the accuracy is to low for both, so we don't use it right now.
This also means all the text is flat (no headings, different formattings etc.).

We enable Drawing + Image Detection because we may need to understand what paragraph is following which other one.
This may be helpful when to decide whether to join paragraphs.

In the JSON output is a field `pageNumber`.
This comes from the page detection module.
`pageNumber`: Derived from header / footer of each page.
So it may be differentÂ from the array of pages.
Don't relay on `pageNumber` in the JSON output.

`words-to-line-new` has be used like this.
There is no error but the accuracy decreases if it used otherwise.

```json
"words-to-line-new",
[
    "reading-order-detection",
```

Don't do OCR with Parsr because the results are worse than OCRmyPDF (because the latter uses image preprocessing).

## Developement

Install and use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).
