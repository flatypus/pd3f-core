## Parsr Config

Why no heading / list detection?

The feature is pretty broken right now. The false positive of these feature will result in broken text. So let's remove it for now and wait until the results improve.

So it may be differentÂ from the array of pages


Include Drawing + Image Detection because we may need to understand what paragraph is following which other one. Etc.
