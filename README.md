# DDD

Extraact text from PDFs.

It's built upon [parsr]() that's 


## Parsr Config

### Using with GPU (CUDA)


0. install [conda]() and [poety]()
1. create a new conda enviroment & activate it
1. Install PyTorch with CUDA
2. Install pdddf with poetry

Poetry realizes that it is run within a conda virtual env so it doesn't create a new one.
Since setting up CUDA is hard, use the most easy way (with conda)


## Developement

Use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).
